function wnm=Residual_analysis_for_filtering(th,fs)

%This code performs the residual analysis suggested in the Biomechanics and
%motor control of human movement in section 3.4.4.3 from Winter. This
%function returns the cutoff frequency for the low pass filter determined
%using this method.The intercept a on the ordinate (at 0 Hz) is
%nothing more than the rms value of the noise, because XË†i for a 0-Hz filter is
%nothing more than the mean of the noise over the N samples. When the data
%consist of true signal plus noise, the residual will be seen to rise above 
%the straight (dashed) line as the cutoff frequency is reduced. 
%This rise above the dashed line represents the signal distortion that is 
%taking place as the cutoff is reduced more and more. The final decision is where fc 
%should be chosen. The compromise is always a balance between the signal distortion and 
%the amount of noise allowed through. If we decide that both should be equal, 
%then we simply project a line horizontally from a to intersect the residual line at b. 
%The frequency chosen is fc', and at this frequency the signal distortion is represented by
%bc.
